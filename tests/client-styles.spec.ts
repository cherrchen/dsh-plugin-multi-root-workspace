/**
 * The stylesheet rules that position this plugin's launcher inside the
 * upstream Files tab header.
 *
 * The launcher's place in that header is a CSS `order` effect, not a slot
 * registration property: upstream sorts `files.actions` occupants inside
 * their own slot, so the only way to sit between the path label and the
 * reload button is the flex order of the wrapper element. These assertions
 * pin the rules that effect depends on — an accidental edit that drops the
 * `order` declarations silently reverts the header to the slot order.
